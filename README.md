# d3-audio-geo-visualizer
An interactive project for detecting and visualizing mother tongues using audio input and D3.js.

### Description
This project listens to audio recordings of people speaking and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to determine their mother tongue. It features an audio visualizer that dynamically displays the audio spectrum and a motion map that shows the speaker's country of origin. The project leverages D3.js for creating interactive and animated visualizations.

### Features
- **Audio Input and Processing**: Captures and processes audio in real-time.
- **Mother Tongue Detection**: Uses a machine learning model to identify the speaker's native language.
- **Audio Visualizer**: Displays real-time audio visualizations that react to the speaker's voice.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Animates the speaker's country of origin on a world map.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides an engaging user experience with interactive and dynamic visual elements.

### Technologies Used
- **D3.js**: For creating data-driven visualizations and animations.
- **Web Audio API**: For capturing and analyzing audio input.
- **Machine Learning Model**: For detecting the mother tongue from audio input.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS**: For building the web interface and integrating components.
